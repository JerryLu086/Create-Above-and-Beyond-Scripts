# Create: Above & Beyond - Integration Docs

A repository for guide and examples of how to modify your C:A&B installation.

Note that if you have multiple customizations, the line each doc tells you to find won't be 100% accurate.

Also, I only know little about JS, all I do with it is just modify with KJS, 
I don't even know the object system or things about it, so I might be wrong with many things,
please correct me if I'm incorrect.
